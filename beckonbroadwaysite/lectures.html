                <p class="lecure-txt">When Jerome Kern was asked what was Irving Berlin's place in American music, he said, "Irving Berlin has no place in American music. Irving Berlin IS American music. That was a century ago, but Berlin's music is still known and loved. The holidays would not be the same without "White Christmas" and "Easter Parade." He lived from 1888 to 1889 and wrote and produced songs and musicals from 1919 to 1962. <br> <a href="videos.html#cole"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i></a></p>

                <p class="lecure-txt">Cy Coleman got his start as a prodigy on classical piano. He soon developed a love for jazz and
found success in that genre. And then he began writing popular songs and Broadway musicals.
He is best known for his early singles, Witchcraft and The Best Is Yet to Come, and for such
musicals as Wildcat, Sweet Charity and Barnum. <br> <a href="videos.html#cole"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i></a></p>

‘New York, New York’, ‘All That Jazz’ — but many people don’t know their names. Their shows
often deal with unlikely subjects for Broadway. Think The Kiss of the Spider Woman, which got
its start in Toronto. Think Liza Minnelli, who says they created her.
Meet John Kander and Fred Ebb and the brilliant music they produced. You’ll find lots of razzle
dazzle, plenty of humour, and unusual beauty. <br> <a href="videos.html#cole"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i></a></p>

                <p class="lecure-txt">Jerry Herman set out to write musicals that would make people feel better and leave them humming tunes. One of the few songwriters who wrote both music and lyrics, he is best known for three of Broadways most successful shows: Hello, Dolly, Mame, and La Cage aux Folles. But some of his lesser-known shows are also filled with beautiful and memorable songs. Using photos and video clips, Linda Beck will tell us about Jerry Herman’s life and share examples of his songs. <br> <a href="videos.html#cole"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i></a></p>

                <p>Shakespeare’s plays often included music, but no one thought of adapting a Shakespeare play into musical comedy until Rodgers and Hart created <em>The Boys from Syracuse</em> in 1938. It is a close adaptation of The <em>Comedy of Errors.</em> Since that show’s success, many other adaptations have been written; the most successful are <em>West Side Story</em> and <em>Kiss Me, Kate,</em> based on <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> and <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> respectively. In these three cases, dream teams of Broadway talent created lasting masterpieces.

                <p>Fred Astaire’s career began in Vaudeville when he was six years old and danced with his older sister, Adele; it continued on Broadway and went on to great success in the movies. Besides his ten movies with Ginger Rogers, he starred with Eleanor Powell, Rita Hayworth, Cyd Charisse, and others. And his dancing career was followed by serious acting, even earning him an Academy Award nomination for his work in <em>On the Beach.</em> Astaire had a lasting influence on dance in America. Bob Fosse and Michael Jackson are among the dancers and choreographers who have expressed their debt to Fred Astaire. <br><a href="videos.html#fred"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i></a></p>

                <p>Rodgers and Hart met in 1919, when Lorenz Hart was working on shows for Columbia University and Richard Rodgers was still a high school student. The two found they had a similar vision of what musical comedies could be and they began working together. They had a song placed in a Broadway show that very year. Six years later their first full Broadway show made them famous; that was followed by many more successes on Broadway and in Hollywood. They wrote more than five hundred songs together before Hart’s alcoholism led to his early death. <br><a href="videos.html#sing"><i class="fa fa-video-camera"></i></a></p>

He also created Brooksfilms, a production company that is responsible for <em>84 Charing Cross Road</em> and <em>The Elephant Man,</em> among other films.

                    P. G. Wodehouse
                  </span></h3>
                </div>
                <p>The creator of Jeeves, that perfect gentleman’s gentleman, and Bertie Wooster, his ‘mentally negligible’ employer, was already famous as a Broadway writer and lyricist before these fictional characters became known. He used elegant prose and inventive figures of speech to build complex, farcical plots. Wodehouse’s career – and his equanimity – were badly hurt when he was accused of collaborating with his Nazi captors during World War II, and he spent the rest of his life in the United States, still writing successfully about his imagined world of British landed gentry.</p>
