<h3>Three sites I am comparing with:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.boulderzclimbing.com/etobicoke/" target="_blank">Boulderz Etobicoke</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://guelphgrotto.com/" target="_blank">Guelph Grotto</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.joerockheads.com/" target="_blank">Joe Rockheads</a></li>
</ul>
    <h3>General layout likes and dislikes</h3>
       <h4>Images</h4>
        <p>I liked the really big photos that were used in all three sites. I especially liked Joe Rochead's use of big images with big headers over top.</p>  
        <p>On Joe Rockhead’s site, there is a neat fixed image effect. I think it is using JavaScript, but it gives the illusion of 3D layers. The background seems to stay in one place, while the foreground moves on scroll. I decided to try this with HTML and CSS. I knew it wouldn't be exactly the same, but I thought I could do something similar.</p> 
        
        <h4>Overall feel and user ease</h4>
        <p>I preferred the look of Guelph Grotto and Joe Rockhead site overall to Boulderz.</p> 
        <p>I decided to do something more interesting for my own site with a climber image going up the side.</p>            
        <p>Boulderz has a bit of a clumsy look to the layout. There are so many sections of navigation that you don’t know what the main navigation is. There are links at the top that look like contact information, a horizontal menu and another set of links to the right of the main content image, which is floating left. It was confusing to me as a first-time user to their site. At the bottom, there is another section of navigation, which I think goes to the same places as the top.</p>
        
        <h4>Fonts</h4>
        <p>Boulderz is the only site using a serif font and it looks the least modern. The other sites are using modern sans-serif fonts that I would like to use. I prefer sans-serif and think it is easier to read on the web. Merriweather bold (heads) is paired with Oswald (thin body font) for Joe Rockheads. Montserrat and Roboto re on Guelph Grotto. I couldn't tell what font Boulderz used as it might be in the CMS.</p>
        
        <h4>Colour Palettes</h4>          
        <p>All three sites used very minimal colour palettes. The main images on Guelph Grotto and Joe Rockheads are black and white. This gives a modern look, but I don’t know if it really captures the feeling of fun and adventure that climbing is about. They could be representing any kind of gym, even a boxing gym. It doesn't feel warm, or fun and for everyone.</p>
        
        <h4>Navigation</h4>
        <p>All the sites use horizontal navigations. Joe Rockhead’s is the only one who has the navigation to the right of the logo.</p>
        <p>Guelph Grotto has an awkwardly laid out navigation and a black text on red background for one menu item that is meant to stick out. It does stick out, but more like a sore thumb than a nice highlight. It is probably not accessible either due to contrast.</p>
        
        <h4>Headers</h4>
        <p>Joe Rockhead’s and Guelph use really bold headings in all-caps. Joe Rockhead's go over the big full-width images. This is nice looking in my opinion. Boulderz doesn’t even have an obvious H1 heading.</p> 

        <h4>Section Layout</h4>
        <p>Each site uses some use of columns or floats depending on the content. Some details were displayed as lists, which makes sense to me.</p>

        <h4>Tables</h4>
        <p>Tables are used for the pricing on Boulderz and Guelph. The Boulderz one is laid out nicer with alternating row background colours. Joe Rockheads just uses indented lists. Not really as easy to understand.</p>           

        <h4>Layout – Fluid or fixed width</h4>
        <p>All of the sites are using fluid layouts.</p>

       <h4>Demographics</h4>
        <p>Climbing gyms are geared to all ages, including small children and seniors. They seem to be marketing a great deal to parents with kids. They sometimes offer kids birthday parties and different climbs for all levels. The gyms will provide a person to belay (control the rope) for kids while they climb. They also seem to be targeting people who like adventure, and also to physical fitness buffs. Many gyms are starting to buy more traditional workout equipment and even offer yoga classes for climbers. With the emphasis on "all inclusiveness, I don't really understand the modern "pump your body" design of Joe Rockheads. I think if it was a traditional gym, it would be more appropriate.</p>

    <h2 class="my-choices">My choices for Rock or Drop</h2>
    
<div class="wrapper">
        <h4>Images</h4> 
            <p>I chose to use colour images as opposed to black and white. I do like the black and white images in a different context, but I don't think they convey the fun all inclusive feeling I want.</p> 
        <h4>Fonts</h4>
            <p>I definitely like the modern sans-serif fonts. I like the uppercase headers that are large. I like a condensed look for this site so I will try to find something similar. Oswald is so thin that it is nice in my opinion for body copy, but I don’t like when it is used on Joe Rockhead’s in uppercase for an indented list.</p>
            
        <h4>Colours</h4>
            <p>I decided to not be shy on the colour palette of this site. I think that one of the coolest things about a climbing gym is all the colours and shapes. The walls are usually interesting shapes and painted in bright coloured sections. Usually, the holds – small pieces of jut-out shapes, screwed into the wall for propelling yourself up)  are in obvious contrasting colours also. They look cool but also serve a purpose of visually showing the climber which holds they should use for different routes or levels. The whole effect is very exciting visually. I decided to not be shy with colours and bring that whole feel into the design of this site.
            <p>Initially, I looked at websites that have pre-set colour palettes and found one that I liked for adventure. I already had an image of a climbing gym I wanted to use that happened to have very similar colours. The palettes were close.</p> 
            <p>I really think the bright colours go well with the images and the whole adventure theme.</p>
            <p>My original colour palette used a dark blues, a medium blue, an orange, grey, and yellow (plus black), but I also sampled some other colours from my climbing wall image and added them as well. This is something I used to do from my days as a print designer and I think it can carry into web also.</p>

                </li>
            </ul><div class="clear"></div>

<h4>Navigation</h4>
    <p>I decided to do a horizontal menu at the top. I like this look and the samples I looked at all used them. It seems to be very common. I did a simple hover effect over the menu to highlight with colour.</p>

<h4>Layout</h4>
    <p>I decided to do the header and footer full width to the screen. I wanted to go smaller width for the middle main content section because I think you can scroll down further to the bottom and it gives that whole feeling of height. This should work well with the whole climbing theme. It’s all about climbing up and repelling down.</p>
    
<h4>Image concepts</h4>
    <p>I wanted an image to the left of the content, with a climber going up. I thought it would be cool if the climber would go up with the content. I originally had an idea of a photo of a climber, but couldn't find a really perfect image and I wanted the transparent background. I found a clipart image that I was able to use and I just changed the colour to one I was using in my palette.</p>
    <p>I liked the transparency effect where the photo seems to stay in one place and the content moves up over the image. You can see it in Joe Rockheads site. I knew they were using javascript for the effect, but I was pretty sure there was a way to do something similar with just HTML and CSS. I was able to consult with an expert TA and find a snippet of code to use for this.</p> 

<h4>More layout choices</h4>
    <p>I created a simple logo for the website. If found a free clipart climber to incorporate into it. </p> 
<p>I will use a list or table for the prices section, depending on how many details there are. 
I put some made up contact information for the gym. I put this at the top, but not right in the header. I decided to do something different by putting it on the big image.</p>   
<h4>Footer</h4> 
    <p>I wanted a consistent footer that runs the whole bottom width of the website.</p> 
<h4>My rough sketch</h4>

    <img class="sketch" src="img/roughsketch.jpg" width="500" height="667" alt="rough sketch">
    <p>This was my original sketch I used as a starting point for the climber image. I didn’t see this used on other websites, but it is a concept I had that I wanted to try and work out. I ended up using clipart as you know instead of a photo.</p>
