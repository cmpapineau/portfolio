      <h2>Your Toronto Indoor Climbing Expert</h2>
      <p>Our climbing walls and routes are crafted to provide a rewarding experience, one that is fun and challenging. They are designed to be effective as both an introduction to climbing for beginners and for honing the skills of the seasoned climber.</p>
      <p>The truth about climbing: anyone who can climb stairs can reach the top of our climbing walls. Our goal is to make sure everyone has success at Rock or Drop. In just an hour your confidence will be raised and you’ll be shocked by what you've achieved and by how engaged you are – mentally and physically. There are walls of all different heights so you can start off slow. Don't worry about fearing heights. It is perfectly natural to have that sense of fear. It's part of our natural makeup. After becoming used to the harness catching you, your natural fear will disappear and you will be thinking of nothing but UP!</p> 
<p>
We have every age from 3 to 83 at our gym and all different weights. We’ve had people who haven’t done anything “active” in 30 years get to the top of a route first try. We’ve had kids on our climbing team who had been told their whole life that they were uncoordinated (because they weren’t good at ball sports) compete at national climbing competitions.</p>
